### How It Works
* Start rating products immediately without signing up for an account, or log in to rate products and upload your own items for review. 
* Simply upload a product image and add a title, location, and description. The product will be saved to your account page and will also be displayed on the Rate page for others to review based on the following criteria: Quality, Appeal, and Value.
* On the User page, you can add more products for review or access your list of uploaded products.
* Clicking on a specific product on your User page will redirect you to that product's review data.
* Charts and graphs on the product's page will show the ratings distribution, total votes, and averages.
